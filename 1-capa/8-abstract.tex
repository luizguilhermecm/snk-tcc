\begin{Abstract}
        The goal of this work is the optimization of computation of loops.
        Computationally expensive programs in general spend most of their time
        in the execution of loops.
        Loops with a large number of iterations over a big data arrays, those are
        the ones that spend of the process execution time.
        Thus, they are eligible to produce better results after optimization.
        Tecniques of loop transformation such as, loop unswitching, loop fission,
        loop fusion, loop unrolling, among others, was used in optimization.
        Analysis of data dependence was necessary to keep the meaning of the 
        program after the optimizations.
