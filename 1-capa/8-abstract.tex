\begin{Abstract}
        Code parallelization allows to the developer an oportunity to create algorithms to solve problems with more efficiency.
        A program is said to be parallel if it can have two or more action executing simultaneously in differents processing units.
        The goal of this work is studying parallelization techniques and try to develop a tecnique or optimization applied to code parallelization.
