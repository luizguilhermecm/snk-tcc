\begin{Abstract}
        The goal of this work is the optimization of computation of loops,
        computationally expensive programs in general spend most of their time
        in execution of loops.
        Loops with a big number of iterations over a big data arrays, those are
        the ones that spend most time in execution and has a considerable
        potential of results after optimization.
        Tecniques of loop transformation as, loop unswitching, loop fission,
        loop fusion, loop unrolling, among others, was used to optimization.
        Analysis of data dependence was necessary to keep the meaning of the 
        program after the optimizations.
